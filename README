Qt Adapter For StoryText
========================
StoryText is a functional testing or acceptance testing tool.
This adapts StoryText to the Qt GUI framework or toolkit.
(Currently StoryText supports other frameworks, for example Gtk.)

Intended Audience
=================
Experienced StoryText developers.

Status
======
WORK IN PROGRESS.
A partial proof of concept.
This does not prove it is possible for Storytext to support Qt adequately.
There could be unforeseen, insurmountable technical problems.
It is incomplete (doesn't support much of the Qt widget set.)
It works for a very small test case.

Installation
============
You should have already installed TextTest (which includes StoryText.)
Installation is a hack of the texttest directory.
Do NOT do this on a production system.
Also, if you have installed texttext (as opposed to just setting PYTHON_PATH to find it),
you will need to adjust these instructions.

Move this directory under texttest-3.22/source/storytext/lib/storytext, alongside the gtktoolkit directory.
Make a link to this directory named "qttoolkit".
> cd texttest-3.22/source/storytext/lib/storytext
> ln -s StoryTextQt qttoolkit.

Apply the enclosed patch file adminactions.py.patch to the unpatched file further up the texttest source tree.
This patch does: when you use TextTest/StoryText, "Qt" is a choice in the pulldown menu of QUI toolkits.

Apply the enclosed patch __init__.py.patch to the original: texttest-3.22/source/storytext/lib/storytext/__init__.py.
This patch does: adds function setSUTReady() to storytext that the SUT calls just before entering the event loop.

Test Case
=========

This has been tested on the enclosed Qt app "testSUT.py".
