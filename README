Qt Adapter For StoryText
========================
StoryText is a functional testing or acceptance testing tool.
This adapts StoryText to the Qt GUI framework or toolkit.
(Currently StoryText supports other frameworks, for example Gtk.)

Intended Audience
=================
Experienced StoryText developers.

Status
======
WORK IN PROGRESS.
A partial proof of concept.
This does not prove it is possible for Storytext to support Qt adequately.
There could be unforeseen, insurmountable technical problems.
It is incomplete (doesn't support much of the Qt widget set.)
It works for a very small test case.

Installation
============
You should have already installed TextTest (which includes StoryText.)

Move this directory (qttoolkit) under texttest-3.22/source/storytext/lib/storytext,
alongside the gtktoolkit directory.

Apply the enclosed patch file adminactions.py.patch to the unpatched file further up the source tree.
This patch: when you use TextTest/StoryText, Qt is a choice in the pulldown menu of QUI toolkits.
